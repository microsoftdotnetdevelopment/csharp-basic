// Generic classes are extensively used by collection classes available in System.Collections.Generic namespace

// In this example, AreEqual(int value1, int value2) only works with int data type. If, we pass any other data type, we get a compiler error. 
// So, AreEqual() method in Calculator class is tightly coupled with the int data type, and prevents it from being used with any other data type.

	public class MainClass

			bool Equal = Calculator.AreEqual(1, 2);

// It's a compile time error to invoke AreEqual() method with string parameters.
// bool Equal = Calculator.AreEqual("A", "B");
// One way of making AreEqual() method reusable, is to use object type parameters. 
// Since, every type in .NET directly or indirectly inherit from System.Object type, AreEqual() method works with any data type,
// but the problem is performance degradation due to boxing and unboxing happening. 

// Also, AreEqual() method is no longer type safe. It is now possible to pass integer for the first parameter, and a string for the second parameter. 
// It doesn't really make sense to compare strings with integers. 

namespace Pragim1
{
	public class MainClass
	{
		private static void Main1()
		{
			bool Equal = Calculator.AreEqual("A", "B");
			if (Equal)

	}
	public class Calculator
	{
		public static bool AreEqual(object value1, object value2)
		{
			return value1 == value2;
		}
	}
}
// So, the probem with using System.Object type is that
// 1. AreEqual() method is not type safe
// 2. Performance degradation due to boxing and unboxing.

// Both of these issues can be solved with generics and still make AreEqual() method work with different data types. The re written example using generics is shown below. 

namespace Pragim2
{
	public class MainClass
	{
		private static void Main2()
		{
			bool Equal = Calculator.AreEqual<int>(2, 1);
			if (Equal)
			{
				Console.WriteLine("Equal");
			}
			else
			{
				Console.WriteLine("Not Equal");
			}
		}
	}
	public class Calculator
	{
		public static bool AreEqual<T>(T value1, T value2)
		{
			return value1.Equals(value2);
		}
	}
}
// To make AreEqual() method generic, we specify a type parameter using angular brackets as shown below.
// public static bool AreEqual<T>(T value1, T value2)
// At the point, When the client code wants to invoke this method, they need to specify the type, they want the method to operate on. 
// If the user wants the AreEqual() method to work with integers, they can invoke the method specifying int as the datatype using angular brackets as shown below.
// bool Equal = Calculator.AreEqual<int>(2, 1);
// To operate with string data type
// bool Equal = Calculator.AreEqual<string>("A", "B");
// In this example, we made the method generic. Along the same lines, it is also possible to make classes, interfaces and delegates generic.
