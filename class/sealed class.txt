Sealed classes are used to restrict the inheritance feature of object oriented programming. Once a class is defined as a sealed class, the class cannot be inherited. 
A sealed class cannot also be an abstract class. Because abstract class has to provide functionality and here we are restricting it to inherit.

        public sealed class BaseClass
        {
            public void Display()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("This is a sealed class which can;t be further inherited");
        }
    }
 
        public class Derived : BaseClass
        {
            // this Derived class can;t inherit BaseClass because it is sealed
        }
   
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            BaseClass obj = new BaseClass();
 
            obj.Display();
 
            Console.ReadLine();
        }
