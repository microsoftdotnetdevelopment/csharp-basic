A struct type is a value type that is typically used to encapsulate small groups of related variables, such as the coordinates of a rectangle or the characteristics of an item in an inventory. 
public struct Square
{
    public int i, j;
    public Square(int x1, int x2)
    {
        i = x1;
        j = x2;
    }
}

// Declare and initialize struct objects. 
class TestSquare
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Initialize:   
        Square squ1 = new Square();
        Square squ2 = new Square(2, 3);
        // Display results:
        Console.Write("Square 1: ");
        Console.WriteLine("i = {0}, j = {1}", squ1.i, squ2.j);
        Console.Write("Square 2: ");
        Console.WriteLine("i = {0}, j = {1}", squ2.i, squ2.j);
        // Keep the console window open in debug mode.
        Console.WriteLine("Press any key to exit.");
        Console.ReadKey();
    }
}

When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result:

Square 1: i = 0, j = 0

Square 2: i = 10, j = 10
