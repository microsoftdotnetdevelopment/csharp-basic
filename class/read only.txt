Readonly is the keyword whose value we can change during runtime or we can assign it at run time but only through the non-static constructor
const's are implicitly static
public class Const_V_Readonly
{
  public const int I_CONST_VALUE = 2;
  public readonly int I_RO_VALUE;
  public Const_V_Readonly()
  {
     I_RO_VALUE = 3;
  }
}
